CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:9 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findmrt_cmake_modules.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "mrt_cmake_modules", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "mrt_cmake_modules"
  with any of the following names:

    mrt_cmake_modulesConfig.cmake
    mrt_cmake_modules-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "mrt_cmake_modules" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "mrt_cmake_modules_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "mrt_cmake_modules" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
